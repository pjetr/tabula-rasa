# Tabula Rasa
I wanted to make an open-source new-tab plugin for chrome, as I didn't find any that suited my needs.

I should add that I haven't looked too hard, because mostely, I wanted to write my own plugin.

## What are my needs?
On a basic level: 

* Using [r/earthporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/top/) top posts as background.
* Displaying an inspirational quote
* Have a todolist
* show my currently playing music from spotify

But here's why I wanted to write my own:

* Jira / bitbucket integration
* Wunderlist (and others) integration
* Github integration
* Quick notes to github-gist
* time tracker
* ...

## What is ready as of yet?
Well, ...

I have a readme.md, and decided it should be GPL2.0, because [Linus said so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaKIZ7gJlRU).

Yeah, that's about it.
